      <h2 class="heading"> Mission and Concepts </h2>
      <p> Our mission is to motivate EVERY students at age 11 and above to code.
        Through the process, students not only learn computational thinking, problem-solving
        as many coding
        initiates intend to do, but also learn to manage their computer, understand the nature
        of internet, what coding is about, and apply it. We design this program consisted of
        three sections. The first section is recommended before moving on to the later sections.

      <ol>
        <li><a href="#section1">Section 1: HTML/CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="#section2">Section 2: JavaScript</a></li>
        <li><a href="#section3">Section 3: Python and Raspberry Pi</a></li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>
      <h2> HTML/CSS </h2>
      <p> HTML is the standard markup language for web pages and easy to learn. There is no
        mathematical or logical commands invovlved as most computer programmings have. </p>
      <p> CSS works together with HTML to styles the layout of the web page by adding
         to HTML elements in three ways: inline, internal, and external. </p>
      <p> TechCoachDIY recommends to write HTML/CSS as the first step of learning text coding.
        This is based on
        <a href="https://view.joomag.com/teach-middle-east-magazine-sep-dec-2019-issue-1-volume-7/0440805001567443261?short">
          successful student outcomes</a> (page 38-39) from approximately 400 7th and 8th grade students.
        Students were engaged, feeling rewarded, and producing good quality of works. Students will be
        guided to learn through free on-line resource (e.g. codecademy) and work on designed projects.

        <li><a href="#">5th Grader 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">5th Grader 3</a><li>
      </ul>

       <h2 id="section2">Section 2</h2>
       <h2> JavaScript </h2>
       <p> JavaScript enables interactive web pages from the client-side page. The main goal
         here is to learn mathematical function and logical commands through JavaScript while
         applying JavaScript to create dynamic web page. Students will be guided to learn through
         free on-line resource (e.g. codeHS) and work on designed projects.
       </p>
      <h2 id="section3">Section 3</h2>
      <h2> Python and Raspberry Pi </h2>
      <P> The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed by the Raspberry
        Pi Foundation in UK. Python is its default progarmming language. The purpose of this section is to
      learn how computer works and hardware/software communication.
